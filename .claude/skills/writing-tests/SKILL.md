# Writing Tests

You are about to author or repair automated tests. The engine is you understanding what the code is *supposed to do* and pinning that behavior down — not padding a coverage number. A test that passes without exercising real behavior, or that breaks the moment an implementation detail changes, is worse than no test: it manufactures false confidence. **A test that never actually ran, or that passes for the wrong reason, is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent** — every test you add is executed and shown to pass for real, and every regression test is shown to fail on the unfixed code first.

## 1. Understand the unit under test

**You cannot test behavior you have not characterized — read the code and its contract before writing a line of test.** Pin down, for the unit in scope:

- **Behavior**: what it computes or decides, in plain terms.
- **Inputs**: parameters, their types, valid ranges, and what "invalid" means.
- **Outputs**: return values and their shape across the input space.
- **Side effects**: I/O, mutation, network, DB, logging, events — what crosses a boundary.
- **Contracts**: pre/postconditions, invariants, documented errors, and edge behavior the callers rely on.

Test **behavior, not implementation**. Assert on observable outputs and effects, not on private helpers, call order, or internal state. If a refactor that preserves behavior would break your test, the test is coupled to the implementation — rewrite it against the contract.

## 2. Detect the project test stack and conventions

**Match what exists — never introduce a new test framework, runner, or assertion library into a repo that already has one.** Before writing, detect the stack and mirror it: framework, runner and invocation command, test-file naming and location, fixture/factory patterns, assertion style, and setup/teardown idioms. The detection procedure and per-ecosystem signals are in **`references/framework-conventions.md`** — read it to identify the stack and copy its conventions exactly. When a repo has no test setup at all and the user is asking you to establish one, that reference also covers picking an ecosystem-default runner.

## 3. Design the cases

**Enumerate cases across categories before writing — an untested edge or error path is a gap, not a detail.** For the unit in scope, design cases spanning:

- **Happy path** — representative valid inputs producing expected outputs.
- **Edge / boundary** — empty, zero, one, max, off-by-one, null/None, unicode, ordering, duplicates.
- **Error / exception** — invalid inputs and failure modes; assert the *specific* error type and message, not just "it throws".
- **Property-based** (where valuable) — invariants that hold across generated inputs (round-trips, idempotence, ordering, conservation). Use the repo's property library if one exists.

Case-design heuristics, the boundary checklist, and when property-based earns its keep are in **`references/test-design.md`**.

## 4. Write the tests to repo conventions

**One behavior per test, arranged so a failure names its own cause.** Follow:

- **AAA** — Arrange (set up inputs and world), Act (invoke the unit once), Assert (check outputs and effects). Keep the three visually distinct.
- **Deterministic** — no reliance on wall-clock, random seeds, network, or ordering of other tests. Inject or freeze time and randomness.
- **Fast & isolated** — no shared mutable state between tests; each sets up and tears down its own world.
- **Minimal mocking** — mock only at **trust boundaries** (network, clock, filesystem, third-party services), never the unit under test or your own pure logic. Over-mocking tests the mocks, not the code.
- **Named to describe behavior** — the test name states the expected behavior, so a failure in CI reads as a sentence.

## 5. Verify — run them, and prove they fail for the right reason

**A test you did not run is not done; a regression test that never went red does not guard anything.** For every test you add or repair:

1. **Run it** using the repo's own command (from §2). A new test must actually execute — a skipped, filtered-out, or uncollected test is a silent no-op.
2. **Pass for real** — confirm green, then sanity-check it isn't vacuous (an assertion that can't fail, e.g. `assert True`, is a bug).
3. **For a regression test: show it goes red on the unfixed code first.** Add the failing test before (or with the fix reverted), watch it fail with the expected error, then apply/restore the fix and watch it pass. A regression test that was never red proves nothing.

Pair this with the Claude Code built-in **verify** skill to exercise the change end-to-end, not just at the unit boundary.

## 6. Coverage: target behaviors, not a percentage

**Chase uncovered behaviors and risk, not a coverage number.** A coverage report is a map of *untested behavior* — read it to find branches, error paths, and edge cases nobody exercises, and write cases for the ones that carry real risk. Do not add tests solely to move a percentage, and do not assert on a coverage threshold as if it were a behavior. 100% line coverage with no boundary or error cases is a weaker suite than 70% that pins the contract.

## 7. Orchestration: generate tests for many modules at once

A handful of modules you can test inline in this session. For **a whole package or a coverage sweep across many modules, run it as a multi-agent workflow** using the template at **`templates/test-generation.workflow.js`**:

1. **Design fan-out** — one agent per module characterizes the unit and designs its cases (§1, §3), returning a structured case list.
2. **Write** — per module, one agent writes the tests to repo conventions (§2, §4) from that case list.
3. **Run (optional)** — per module, execute the new tests and report pass/fail, so a broken or vacuous file surfaces instead of shipping green-by-accident.

This is the **pipeline** pattern (design → write → run per module, no barrier between modules) from the **`workflow`** skill (see its `templates/pipeline.workflow.js` and harness policy H1 pipeline-default, H4 adversarial verify). Invoke the `workflow` skill to author and execute the run; the test-generation template pre-wires the case schema, the convention-matching step, and the run-and-report gate. For a module or two you can hold in context, skip the workflow and write the tests directly.
