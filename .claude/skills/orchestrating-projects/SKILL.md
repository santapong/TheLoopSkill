# Orchestrating Projects

You are the project manager for a multi-agent job. This skill is a **planning layer on top of the sibling `workflow` skill (`../workflow`)** — it does not introduce a new execution engine. The Workflow tool, the harness and loop policies, the JS templates, and the AIDLC framework are all **unchanged**; you reuse them exactly as `../workflow/SKILL.md` prescribes. Your job is to decide *what work exists, in what order, and who runs it* — then hand each phase to the workflow engine to execute.

The PM adds four things on top of a raw workflow run:

1. A typed **task DAG** — the project decomposed into dependency-ordered nodes.
2. A per-node **orchestration-shape** decision, made under the unchanged harness/loop rules.
3. A per-node **model + effort tier** assignment — the right model for the right job.
4. A **cast + cost ledger** and a completeness critic layered onto the normal workflow reporting.

## Execution flow

Follow these steps in order.

### 1. Parse the project

From the skill args, extract:

- **project** — everything that is not a flag: the goal to orchestrate. If empty, ask the user what project to run.
- **`--budget <tokens>`** — a total token ceiling for the whole project (e.g. `--budget 2000000`). Splits across phases in the ledger (step 8). Omit for no ceiling.
- **`--dry-run`** — if present, produce the plan (DAG + ledger + first-phase script) and show it to the user, but do NOT execute.

### 2. Load the governing documents (unchanged)

Read, and treat as read-only law:

1. `../workflow/references/harness-policy.md` — orchestration-shape rules (H1–H12).
2. `../workflow/references/loop-policy.md` — iteration rules (L1–L8).
3. `../workflow/frameworks/AIDLC.md` — the default lifecycle framework (Inception → Construction → Operation, with human gates).

Then read this skill's own planning references:

4. `references/task-decomposition.md` — how to build the typed task DAG.
5. `references/model-routing.md` — the "right model for the right job" table (model + effort tier per task type).

If the user named a different framework, load `../workflow/frameworks/<name>.md` instead of AIDLC — the PM layer is framework-agnostic.

### 3. Decompose the project into a typed task DAG

Per `references/task-decomposition.md`, break the project into **nodes**. Each node is a plain object:

```
{
  id,          // stable kebab-case identifier, unique in the DAG
  description, // one line: what this task produces
  taskType,    // scout | analyze | implement | verify | judge | synthesize | critic | doc
  dependsOn,   // [] of node ids that must complete first — this is the DAG edge set
  fanOut,      // 1 for a single agent, or the item-count / "unknown" for a sweep
  model,       // assigned in step 5 (leave null here)
  effort,      // assigned in step 5 (leave null here)
  isolation,   // 'none' by default; 'worktree' only for concurrent file mutation (H7)
  schema,      // JSON schema for machine-consumed output (H3), or null for terminal prose
  phase        // the framework phase this node belongs to (must match meta.phases)
}
```

Rules:

- **Edges are dependencies, not schedule.** `dependsOn` records what must finish first; the workflow engine (via `pipeline()`) extracts the parallelism. Don't serialize nodes that don't actually depend on each other.
- **A fan-out is one node, not N.** A "verify each finding" sweep is a single node with `fanOut` = the finding count (or `"unknown"` for discovery); it becomes one `parallel()`/loop inside a stage.
- **Group nodes by `phase`.** Every node carries the framework phase it belongs to; the phase set becomes `meta.phases` (H9).

### 4. Choose the orchestration shape per node (unchanged rules)

For each node, pick the shape using the **unchanged** harness/loop policy — do not invent new rules:

- **Default to `pipeline()`** (H1). A chain of dependent nodes with a known work-list is one pipeline, no barriers.
- **Earn every barrier** (H2). Use a `parallel()` barrier before a node only when it needs cross-item context from all of its dependencies (dedup/merge, zero-count early-exit, "compare against the other findings"). "Cleaner code" or "I need to flatten first" is not a barrier.
- **Loop only for unknown size** (L1/L6). A node whose `fanOut` is `"unknown"` (find *all* of something) is loop-until-dry; a `--budget`-scaled depth sweep is loop-until-budget with the `budget.total &&` guard (L2). A known work-list is a pipeline, never a loop.
- **Verification scales to the ask** (H4): single-vote for "any bugs", 3–5-vote adversarial or perspective-diverse for "thorough audit", judge panel for wide solution spaces.

### 5. Assign a model + effort tier per node

This is the PM's signature move: **the right model for the right job.** Consult `references/model-routing.md` and set `model` and `effort` on every node.

- The harness default is to **omit `model`** and inherit the session model (H8) — that remains the correct choice for the majority of nodes. Only assign a model when the node's `taskType` justifies deviating.
- The routing table maps `taskType` → tier. In short: mechanical/scout/doc work → cheapest capable model at `effort: 'low'`; core analysis/implementation → mid tier at `effort: 'high'`; the hardest reasoning, adversarial judging, and long-horizon synthesis → top tier at `effort: 'xhigh'`/`'max'`. See the table for the exact model IDs and the escape hatches.
- Record a one-line **rationale** per node for the ledger (step 8) — why this tier, not a cheaper one. A node you can't justify above the session default should stay at the default.

### 6. Compose with AIDLC — default cast + human gates

Map the DAG onto the framework's phases and give each phase a **default cast** — the set of `taskType`s that phase expects (per `AIDLC.md`): Inception is scouts + a synthesizer; Construction is implement → verify chains plus an adversarial review sweep; Operation is a verification loop + doc/critic nodes. A node whose `taskType` doesn't fit its phase's cast is a decomposition smell — revisit step 3.

**Honor the human gates.** AIDLC ends each phase at a gate (H11). At each gate the PM stops, presents the phase deliverable, and **re-plans and re-budgets the next phase** against what actually happened — the DAG downstream of a gate is provisional until the gate is passed. Author one workflow per gated phase (step 7), not one monolith for the whole project.

### 7. Author the plan

Start from `templates/project-plan.workflow.js` and fill its `EDIT ME` slots for the **current phase's** sub-DAG. The template is an ordinary `../workflow` script — it obeys every rule in `../workflow/SKILL.md` step 5 (pure-literal `meta` first, plain JS, no `Date.now()`/`Math.random()`, `args`-parameterized, `.filter(Boolean)` on fan-outs, `schema` on every consumed `agent()`, `log()` progress). The PM additions the template carries:

- Per-node `model` / `effort` / `isolation` passed through to each `agent()` call from the node's assignment (step 5).
- A `log()` line per node emitting its ledger row (model, effort, est tokens, running spend vs budget).
- `meta.phases` mirroring the framework phase names for the nodes in this workflow.

If `--dry-run`, print this script plus the DAG and ledger, and stop.

### 8. Execute — hand to the workflow engine

Call the **Workflow tool** with the current phase's script inline and the DAG parameters as `args` (never a JSON-encoded string). Note the returned `scriptPath` and `runId`; to iterate a phase, edit the persisted file and re-invoke with `{scriptPath, resumeFromRunId}`. Between gated phases, author the next phase as a fresh Workflow invocation after the user approves — the PM session stays in the loop.

### 9. Report — journal + cast/cost ledger + completeness critic

Reuse the normal workflow reporting and add the PM layer on top:

- **Reuse `meta.phases` + `log()` + the run journal.** Relay the structured result in prose; if a result looks wrong, read `<transcriptDir>/journal.jsonl` before diagnosing (it records each agent's actual return value).
- **Emit the cast + cost ledger.** One row per executed node: `id`, `taskType`, `model`, `effort`, estimated tokens, **rationale**, and **running spend vs `--budget`**. This is the PM's accountability artifact — it shows where the token budget went and why each node ran at its tier. Flag any node whose actual spend materially exceeded its estimate.
- **Run a completeness critic** (H12). End the project (or each comprehensive phase) with a critic node asking "what's missing — a node not run, a dependency unverified, a phase skipped?" Its findings become the next round of work or are reported as known gaps.
- **Present the gate deliverable.** If a framework gate was reached, show the phase's deliverable and the re-plan/re-budget for the next phase, and ask the user to approve before authoring it.

## What this layer does NOT change

- It does **not** modify or fork `../workflow` — the harness policy, loop policy, JS templates, and AIDLC framework are consumed read-only.
- It does **not** add orchestration primitives. Every node still becomes a `pipeline()`, `parallel()`, or loop from the unchanged templates.
- It does **not** override the human gates. AIDLC's gates are the PM's phase boundaries.
- The DAG, model routing, and ledger are **planning and reporting artifacts** layered around an otherwise-standard workflow run.

- `references/model-routing.md` — the "right model for the right job" table: `taskType` → model + effort tier, with rationale and escape hatches.
- `templates/project-plan.workflow.js` — a `../workflow` script template that realizes one phase's sub-DAG with per-node model/effort/isolation and the ledger `log()` lines.
