# Non-Functional Requirements

The features say what the system does; the NFRs say whether anyone can rely on it. The engine here is a single discipline: **make the requirements state themselves as numbers before you draw a box, then walk the finished design back against each number and name where it breaks first.** "Fast," "reliable," and "scalable" are not requirements — they are wishes until someone writes down *p99 under 200ms*, *99.9% over 28 days*, *10k rps at launch*. A design you cannot validate against its NFRs is not done; it's a hope with a diagram.

Read this on **step 1** of the workflow (turn the brief into numbers) and again on **step 7** (validate the design against them), or when the user asks "what should my SLOs be?", "how many nines do I need?", "how do I make this observable?", "will this scale?", "should we build or buy this?", or "how much will it cost to run?". Two pillars — Security and the rollout mechanics of Reliability — have deeper homes: security threat-modeling lives in the **reviewing-code** skill, and caching/resilience/rollback mechanics live in `references/backend.md` and `references/deployment.md`. This file owns the *targets* and cross-references those for the *machinery*.

## Requirements intake: the numbers that decide the architecture

Before any box is drawn, pin down the constraints that actually move the design. Each is a question with a *number* as its answer, and each number forecloses or forces a specific decision. **Do not proceed on assumptions — ask.** An unstated NFR is a decision someone else makes for you at 3am.

| Constraint | The number to pin down | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| **Scale** | rps now and in 12 months, data volume, read:write ratio | Single node vs. horizontal fleet; whether one store suffices |
| **Growth** | the curve (linear? 10x/yr?) | "Design for 10x current, plan to rewrite before 100x" |
| **Latency** | p50 / p99 / p99.9 per critical path | Sync vs. async, caching tier, colocation, read replicas |
| **Availability** | uptime SLO as a nines target + window | Redundancy, multi-AZ/region, hard-dependency count |
| **Durability** | acceptable data loss (RPO) and recovery time (RTO) | Backup cadence, replication mode, DR strategy |
| **Consistency** | which ops must be strong vs. tolerate staleness | Per-domain consistency policy (see `references/backend.md`) |
| **Throughput bursts** | peak:average ratio, spike shape | Autoscaling headroom, queue buffering, rate limits |
| **Compliance** | PII/PCI/HIPAA/GDPR, data residency | Encryption, audit logging, regional pinning, retention |
| **Team & ops** | team size, on-call maturity, incumbent stack | How much operational surface you can afford to run |
| **Cost ceiling** | monthly budget and/or cost-per-unit target | Managed vs. self-run, instance sizing, architecture ceiling |

The intake output is a one-page brief of numbers. **Everything downstream cites it.** When you later write "we chose X," the sentence is only complete as "we chose X *because* the p99 target is 50ms and the default can't hit it."

## The six pillars: a lens, not a checklist to worship

The AWS Well-Architected Framework's six pillars are a good *review lens* — run the design past each and ask its question. Depth follows below for the ones with real mechanics; treat this as the index.

- **Operational Excellence** — *Can we run, observe, and change this safely?* Everything as code, small reversible changes, observability wired in from day one, post-incident learning without blame. See Observability below and `references/deployment.md`.
- **Security** — *Who can do what, and how would an attacker get in?* Least privilege, defense in depth, encryption in transit and at rest, secrets out of code, an auditable trail. Threat-model it with the **reviewing-code** skill; do not hand-wave this pillar.
- **Reliability** — *Does it stay up and recover?* Redundancy, no single points of failure, graceful degradation, tested backups, and a rehearsed recovery path (RTO/RPO). See Availability math below.
- **Performance Efficiency** — *Are we using the right resource shapes, and do we know when to change?* Right primitives, measured against SLIs, re-evaluated as load shifts. See Scalability and SLOs below.
- **Cost Optimization** — *Are we paying only for value delivered?* Right-sizing, elasticity to demand, kill idle resources, attribute spend to owners. See Cost below.
- **Sustainability** — *What's the footprint per unit of work?* Maximize utilization, right-size, shape demand, choose efficient regions. Largely the same moves as cost — an efficient system is usually a cheaper *and* greener one; when they diverge, name the trade.

**Failure mode**: treating the pillars as a compliance ritual — a doc that says "yes we considered security" and changes nothing. The lens is only worth running if a pillar's question is allowed to *change the design*.

## Availability math: nines compose, and they multiply the wrong way

Availability is a probability, and probabilities in series multiply. That single fact drives most of the reliability decisions.

| SLO | Downtime / year | / month | / week |
|---|---|---|---|
| 99% (two nines) | 3.65 days | 7.2 h | 1.68 h |
| 99.9% (three nines) | 8.77 h | 43.8 min | 10.1 min |
| 99.95% | 4.38 h | 21.9 min | 5.04 min |
| 99.99% (four nines) | 52.6 min | 4.38 min | 1.01 min |
| 99.999% (five nines) | 5.26 min | 26.3 s | 6.05 s |

**Serial dependencies drag availability down.** A request that must touch five services, each independently 99.9% available, succeeds only when *all five* do: `0.999^5 ≈ 99.5%` — you fell from three nines to barely two by adding hops. Every hard synchronous dependency on a critical path is a subtraction. Fight it by **cutting the number of hard dependencies** (make a dependency non-critical so the request degrades instead of failing), not by demanding impossible nines from each.

**Redundancy multiplies nines back up.** Two independent replicas where either can serve the request fail only when *both* fail: `1 − (0.01 × 0.01) = 99.99%` from two 99% components. This is why redundancy, multi-AZ, and load-balanced fleets buy availability — provided the replicas are genuinely independent (shared dependency = shared failure, and the math evaporates).

**RTO and RPO are the recovery half of availability.** *RTO* (Recovery Time Objective) is how long you may be down after a disaster; *RPO* (Recovery Point Objective) is how much data you may lose. RPO of five minutes forces continuous or near-continuous replication; RPO of a day permits nightly backups. RTO of minutes forces warm standby; RTO of hours permits restore-from-backup. Untested backups have an *infinite* effective RTO — see `references/deployment.md`.

**Smell test**: every nine past three roughly 10x's the cost (redundancy, ops maturity, faster detection). If you can't name the business reason a request needs four nines, you're gold-plating. Set the target from what users actually need, then stop.

## Scalability: scale out, and stay stateless so you can

**Vertical scaling** (a bigger machine) is the right *first* move — it's a config change, no distribution tax, and modern hardware is enormous. It has a hard ceiling and a single failure domain. **Horizontal scaling** (more machines) has effectively no ceiling and gives redundancy for free, but only works if the workload is shardable and the processes are stateless.

**Statelessness is the enabler, not a nicety.** A process that keeps request-affecting state in local memory or on local disk can't be load-balanced freely, killed and rescheduled, or cloned behind an autoscaler — any of those loses the state. Push state to a backing service (DB, cache, object store) and the platform can add, remove, and replace instances at will. This is factors 6/9 of the 12-factor app in `references/backend.md`, and it is the precondition for every horizontal-scaling and zero-downtime-deploy move you'll want later.

- **Default**: stateless services behind a load balancer, state in backing services, autoscale on a demand signal (rps, queue depth, CPU). Scale *up* first for simplicity; design *out* from the start so the option exists.
- **Escape hatch**: genuinely stateful workloads (stream processors, in-memory caches, leader-elected coordinators) exist — partition them by key, replicate deliberately, and accept they scale differently from your stateless tier.
- **Failure mode**: sticky sessions and local file writes that quietly make a "stateless" service stateful; the autoscaler adds an instance and users see logged-out sessions or missing files.

Name the scaling axis and the next bottleneck: *"stateless API scales horizontally to ~50 nodes; past that the shared Postgres write path is the ceiling — the trigger to add read replicas, then shard."*

## SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets

This is how you make reliability an engineering quantity instead of an argument.

- **SLI** (Service Level *Indicator*) — a measured ratio of good events to total: `good requests / valid requests`. Availability SLI = fraction of requests that didn't error; latency SLI = fraction served under a threshold (e.g. under 300ms). Measure it where the user feels it (load balancer / client), not deep in the stack where it looks better than reality.
- **SLO** (Service Level *Objective*) — a target for an SLI over a rolling window: *99.9% of valid requests succeed over 28 days.* Set it **just above what users need, and below 100%.** 100% is the wrong target: unattainable, infinitely expensive, and it removes the room you need to ship.
- **SLA** (Service Level *Agreement*) — the contractual promise with financial penalties. Always set your internal SLO **stricter** than any external SLA, so you burn your own budget before you breach a customer's.
- **Error budget** — `100% − SLO`. A 99.9% SLO grants a 0.1% budget: ~43 minutes of failure per month that you are *allowed to spend* — on releases, risky migrations, chaos experiments, load tests. This is the point of the whole apparatus: it turns "how much can we break things to move fast?" from a turf war into arithmetic. Budget healthy → ship. Budget exhausted → freeze feature work and spend engineering on reliability until it recovers. It aligns dev (wants to ship) and ops (wants stability) behind one shared number.
- **Burn rate** — how fast you're spending the budget. Alert on it with **multi-window, multi-burn-rate** rules: page hard on a fast burn (e.g. 2% of the monthly budget in 1 hour → something is badly wrong *now*), ticket on a slow sustained burn. **Alert on SLO burn (the symptom the user feels), not on causes** like CPU — a saturated CPU that isn't hurting the SLI is not a page.

**Smell test**: if nobody can say what the SLO *is*, there is no shared definition of "broken," so every incident becomes a debate. Define one SLO per critical user journey before launch, not after the first outage.

## Observability: three pillars, one correlation ID, and OpenTelemetry to carry them

Monitoring answers *"is it broken?"* against questions you knew to ask in advance (dashboards, threshold alerts). **Observability** answers *"why is it broken?"* — the ability to interrogate your telemetry about failures you never anticipated, **without shipping new code to ask the question.** Distributed systems fail in unforeseen ways; build for the unknown-unknowns.

The three signal types, each with a job the others can't do:

- **Logs** — discrete timestamped events; the *what happened, in detail*. **Emit them structured** (JSON / key-value), never free-text prose, or they aren't queryable at 3am. Attach a correlation/trace ID to every line. They're the highest-volume, highest-cost signal — **sample or aggregate** the chatty ones; you cannot afford to keep every debug log at scale.
- **Metrics** — aggregated numbers over time; cheap to store, ideal for dashboards and alerts. The trap is **cardinality**: every unique combination of label values is a distinct time series, and putting a user ID or request ID in a metric label detonates cost. Keep labels low-cardinality; high-cardinality identity belongs in logs and traces. Instrument request-driven services with **RED** (Rate, Errors, Duration) and resources with **USE** (Utilization, Saturation, Errors); Google's **four golden signals** — latency, traffic, errors, saturation — are the minimum any user-facing service should expose.
- **Traces** — the path of one request across every service it touched, as a tree of timed spans. This is the signal that tells you *where* the latency or error actually originated in a call graph — the thing logs and metrics can't, because they're per-service. Sample deliberately (tail-based sampling keeps the interesting traces — the slow and failed ones — instead of a blind percentage).

**The three are only powerful when correlated.** Thread one **request/trace ID** through logs, trace spans, and metric exemplars so you can pivot: a metric spikes → jump to an exemplar trace → jump to that request's logs. Without the shared ID you have three disconnected haystacks.

**OpenTelemetry (OTel) is the default instrumentation choice.** It's the vendor-neutral standard — a single set of APIs, SDKs, and the Collector — for generating and exporting all three signals. Instrument your code once against OTel and export to *any* backend, swapping vendors by reconfiguring the Collector rather than re-instrumenting the codebase — so it's also your **lock-in hedge** on the observability vendor. It propagates trace context across service boundaries via W3C Trace Context, which is what makes cross-service traces work at all. Reach for a proprietary agent only when it buys something OTel genuinely can't, and know you're buying lock-in when you do.

## Build vs. buy: TCO, lock-in, and maintenance health

For every non-trivial capability — auth, payments, search, queues, feature flags, the observability backend itself — decide **build, buy (managed/SaaS), or adopt (OSS library).** The default is strong: **do not build undifferentiated heavy lifting.** Build only the capability that is your actual reason to exist; buy or adopt everything else. Engineering time spent rebuilding auth is time not spent on the thing customers pay you for.

Evaluate every candidate on three axes, not just the sticker price:

- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** — the sticker price is the smallest term. Add integration, ongoing maintenance and upgrades, on-call and ops burden, scaling cost at your projected volume, and the **opportunity cost** of the engineers tied up. "Free" OSS has a real TCO: you operate it, patch its CVEs, and carry its pager. Buying trades money for engineering time — usually a good trade for anything off your critical path.
- **Lock-in** — the cost to *leave*. Proprietary APIs, data gravity, and proprietary formats all raise it. Mitigate with a **thin adapter at the seam** and open standards (SQL, OTel, S3-compatible APIs) — but don't build a full portability layer for a switch you'll never make; that's its own premature complexity. Accept lock-in *deliberately* when the managed service's leverage clearly outweighs the exit cost, and write down that you accepted it.
- **Community & maintenance health** (for an OSS dependency) — you are betting someone else keeps maintaining it. Check release cadence, security response time, maintainer count (**bus factor**), open:closed issue ratio, last commit, breaking-change history, and the **license** (permissive vs. copyleft vs. source-available with rug-pull risk). Every dependency is also attack surface and a standing upgrade tax — supply-chain risk lives in the **reviewing-code** skill.

**Smell test**: *"Would I rather my best engineer spend the next quarter building this, or building our product?"* If the honest answer is "build this" only because it's interesting, buy it. Build it because it is the differentiator, or because nothing on the market fits a requirement you can name.

## Cost as a first-class NFR

Cost is an NFR with a number, not an afterthought. Set a **budget and a per-unit target** (cost per request, per tenant, per MAU) so spend scales with value instead of surprising you.

- **Right-size, then autoscale** — most cloud spend is idle over-provisioned capacity. Match instances to real utilization, then let elasticity track demand instead of provisioning for peak 24/7.
- **Pick the pricing model to the workload** — on-demand for spiky/unknown, reserved/committed for steady baseline, spot for interruptible batch. Serverless bills to zero at idle (great for spiky/low-volume) but gets expensive at sustained high volume — know where your crossover is.
- **Watch the silent line items** — cross-AZ and egress data transfer, per-request charges, and storage that only grows because nothing has a retention/tiering policy. Tier cold data to cheaper storage; expire what no one reads.
- **Attribute spend** — tag resources by owner/service so cost has an accountable owner. Unattributed spend never gets optimized.

Cost and Sustainability mostly move together: higher utilization and right-sizing cut both the bill and the footprint. When a reliability or performance target genuinely costs more, that's fine — but *name* the trade so it's a decision, not a drift.

## Pre-sign-off validation checklist

Walk the finished design against this before you call it done. Each unchecked box is a question you're choosing to answer in production.

- [ ] **Every NFR is a number.** Latency, availability, durability, throughput, and cost each have a target from intake — no "fast/reliable/cheap."
- [ ] **Each target maps to a mechanism.** For every number, the design names *how* it's met (this cache, this replica set, this autoscaler) — and **where it breaks first** (the next bottleneck and the scale that triggers it).
- [ ] **Availability math checks out.** Serial critical-path dependencies were counted and multiplied; the composed number meets the SLO, and single points of failure are either removed or consciously accepted.
- [ ] **RTO/RPO have a tested recovery path.** Backups are restored on a schedule, not assumed; failover has been rehearsed.
- [ ] **SLOs and error budgets are defined** per critical journey, with burn-rate alerting on symptoms, and the SLO is stricter than any external SLA.
- [ ] **Observability is wired in, not bolted on.** Structured logs, low-cardinality metrics (RED/USE + golden signals), and cross-service traces, correlated by one trace ID, via OpenTelemetry — before launch, not after the first blind incident.
- [ ] **It scales on a named axis.** Stateless where it needs to scale out; the scaling dimension and its ceiling are stated.
- [ ] **Security pillar was actually threat-modeled** (via **reviewing-code**), not just asserted: authn/z, least privilege, encryption in transit and at rest, secrets externalized, audit trail.
- [ ] **Cost has a budget and a per-unit target**, with spend attributable to an owner.
- [ ] **Build-vs-buy was decided deliberately** for each major capability, with accepted lock-in written down.
- [ ] **The irreversible decisions are captured as ADRs** (`templates/adr-template.md`) — each naming the alternative rejected and why.

If any box can't be checked, the design isn't rejected — it's **unfinished**, and the missing box is the next thing to work on.
