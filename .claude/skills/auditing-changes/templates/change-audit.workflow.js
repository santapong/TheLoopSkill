// Template: CHANGE AUDIT — per-area analyze → impact/risk assess → synthesized report.
// A specialization of the workflow skill's PIPELINE pattern (harness policy H1: pipeline is the
// default shape, no barrier between stages). Each area flows Analyze → Assess independently:
// area A can be in Assess while area B is still being analyzed. The ONLY barrier is the final
// synthesis, which is genuinely earned (H2) — the report needs every area's assessment at once.
//
// This template REPORTS impact and risk; it does not hunt for exploitable defects. The security
// dimension is delegated to the reviewing-code skill (see auditing-changes SKILL §6): run that
// skill on the same base...head range and fold its confirmed findings into the report's risk
// section rather than re-deriving them here. Keep the boundary sharp — an audit that turns into a
// bug hunt produces a noisy half-review and a missing report.
//
// Invoke with: Workflow({ script, args: { areas: [...], base: "main", head: "HEAD" } })
// input.areas — array of changed file-groups to audit; each item is one unit of work in the
//               pipeline. Partition the diff BEFORE authoring (SKILL §8). Shape is up to you —
//               a string path-glob, or an object { name, files:[...], note }.
// input.base  — base ref of the change set (e.g. a tag, branch, or SHA).
// input.head  — head ref of the change set.
